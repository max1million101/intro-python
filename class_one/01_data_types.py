## WARM UP QUIZ

# What is a data type?
# In Computer Science and Computer Programming, a data type (also called simply "type) is a collection of data values that are either a set of possible values, a set of permitted operations for certain values, or values represented by machine type. By constraining possible values, data types allow interpreters and/or compilers to efficiently use certain data in the manner that a programmer wishes it to be use. As a result, many programming languages support basic data types of integers (no matter the size), floating-point numbers (approximations of real numbers, usually labeled as "float"), characters, and Booleans (a data type used in True/False variables and lines of code).

# PART I
a = 5
b = 5.0
c = a / 2
d = b / 2

# What is type(a)?


# What is type(b)?


# What is c?


# What is d?



# EXERCISES

e = [a, b]
f = list(range(0, 10))

# What is type(e)?


# What is len(e)?


# What is type(f)?


# What are the contents of f?


# What is 'list' called? # hint: google it


# What is 'range' called? What happens when you run 'help(range)'?
